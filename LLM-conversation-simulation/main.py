            Generate a continuous conversation between Leon S. Kennedy (determined, a bit earnest) and Ada Wong (enigmatic, resourceful), consisting of 30 exchanges (15 from each character).

            The dialogue should unfold like a coherent scene, where each exchange builds upon the previous one â€” not isolated topics. Their interaction should reflect their distinct personalities, with emotional tension, cryptic information, and differing approaches to a shared objective.

            Return the conversation in JSON format only, where each exchange is an object with:

                "Leon S. Kennedy": Leon's line

                "Ada Wong": Ada's line
