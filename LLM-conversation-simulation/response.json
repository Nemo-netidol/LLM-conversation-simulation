        "Leon S. Kennedy": "We need to work together, Ada. There's too much at stake this time.",
        "Ada Wong": "Isn't that what you said last time? And look how that turned out."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "I know. But we've learned from our mistakes, haven’t we? This is different.",
        "Ada Wong": "Different? Or just the same old song with different lyrics?"
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "You’re always so cryptic. We can't afford doubt now. We need a plan.",
        "Ada Wong": "Plans are just illusions. Ever hear of adaptability, Leon? It's about seizing the moment."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "Adaptability is great, but we need a solid framework to operate. Too much chaos and we’ll lose everything.",
        "Ada Wong": "And what do you propose? That we maneuver through this labyrinth on blind faith?"
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "No, I’m suggesting we lean on each other’s strengths. You’ve got your resources and information; I’ve got... well, I can handle the combat.",
        "Ada Wong": "Ah, the classic divide—strength and intellect. But what happens when intellect fails in the heat of battle?"
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "Then we rely on our instincts. You know that better than anyone. You’ve done it before.",
        "Ada Wong": "Instincts won't save you when surrounded, Leon. Sometimes it takes more than just a trigger finger."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "I’m not just about pulling the trigger. I’m here to keep people safe, and that includes you.",
        "Ada Wong": "Safety is a mirage in our world. Always remember, my safety comes second to my goals."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "You’re always so focused on the end game, Ada. Doesn’t anyone else matter to you?",
        "Ada Wong": "Everyone matters, Leon. But I choose my battles wisely; attachments cloud judgment.",
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "So you just plan to leave again once this is over?",
        "Ada Wong": "Plans have a way of changing. You should know that better than anyone.",
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "I’ve always been willing to fight for what’s right. For you, that fight comes with confusion.",
        "Ada Wong": "Confusion is a product of predictability. I intrigue you, don’t I? Keeps you on your toes."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "Intrigued, yes. Confused? Definitely. I’m trying to find a way to trust you.",
        "Ada Wong": "Trust is a dangerous word, Leon. Perhaps it’s better to work towards a common goal rather than banking on trust."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "But I have to trust you at some level. This partnership relies on it, doesn’t it?",
        "Ada Wong": "A partnership, yes. Trust? That’s a two-way street. Just don’t expect a proper map.",
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "Then we make our own map, one step at a time. I’m willing to try if you are.",
        "Ada Wong": "A tentative truce, then. But remember, Leon, clarity often comes from chaos."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "Just don’t disappear on me again when it gets messy. We face this together.",
        "Ada Wong": "Who knows, Leon? I might surprise you. Sometimes I enjoy the mess."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "As long as I know you’re with me, I can handle any mess. Just say the word.",
        "Ada Wong": "Then let’s see if you can keep up. I don’t wait for anyone, after all."
    },
    {
        "Leon S. Kennedy": "You keep pushing me, and I’ll show you I can keep pace. Just don’t get lost in your shadows, Ada.",
        "Ada Wong": "And you just focus on the light. It’s much safer there, or is it? The unknown has its allure."
